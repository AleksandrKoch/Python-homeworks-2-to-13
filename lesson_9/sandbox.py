# Find Max number
# Create a function to find the largest number in a list without using the built-in max() function.

# - Define a function called find_max that takes a list of numbers as an argument.
# - Initialize a variable result and set it to the 1st item of the list using [0]
#   - This variable will hold the largest number as we iterate through the list.
# - Loop through each number in the list.
# - Check if number > result
#   - If it is, update result with the new greater number.
# - return result

# Define your function here

# Test the function with a sample list of numbers.

# Output should be the maximum number in the list.
